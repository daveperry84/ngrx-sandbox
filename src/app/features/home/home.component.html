            <p>Create a basic Angular application where the user can fill out a dynamic form. The form should
                consist of a few fields (e.g., Name, Email, and a dynamic list of phone numbers) and perform real-
                time validation. The form data should also be saved to the global state, and the app should
                demonstrate interaction with the state management library (NgRx).</p>
