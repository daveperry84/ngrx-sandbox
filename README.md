# NgrxSandbox

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.11.

## Objective

Create a basic Angular application where the user can fill out a dynamic form. The form should consist of a few fields (e.g., Name, Email, and a dynamic list of phone numbers) and perform real-time validation. The form data should also be saved to the global state, and the app should demonstrate interaction with the state management library (NgRx).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
